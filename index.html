    Born and raised in New York City, Tyson became interested in astronomy at the age of nine after a visit to the Hayden Planetarium. After graduating from the Bronx High School of Science, where he was editor-in-chief of the Physical Science Journal, he completed a bachelor's degree in physics at Harvard University in <b>1980</b>. After receiving a master's degree in astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin in <b>1983</b>, he earned his master's (1989) and doctorate (1991) in astrophysics at Columbia University. For the next three years, he was a postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University. In 1994 he joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist and the Princeton faculty as a visiting research scientist and lecturer. In 1996, he became director of the planetarium and oversaw its $210-million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000.

    <h3>Personal quotes</h3>

<p style="color: black" >

The more your ideas are untestable, either in principle or in practice, the less useful they are to the advance of science.
<br><br>
Science is something to be proud of, it allows us to understand the world in spite of ourselves.
<br><br>
Whenever people have used religious documents to make accurate predictions about our base knowledge of the physical world, they have been famously wrong.

<br><br>
My great fear is that we've in fact been visited by intelligent aliens, but they chose not to make contact, on the conclusion that there's no sign of intelligent life on earth. We were sending signals out before we were doing it on purpose. Our early TV shows like 'I Love Lucy' and 'The Honeymooners' and that sort of thing - 'Howdy Doody'. These are our cultural emissaries.
<br><br>
If I went around always calling myself "doctor," that would mean you'd have to believe what I said because of my authority. But, in fact, if what I say is fundamentally true, and you understand why it's true, you never have to reference title again.
